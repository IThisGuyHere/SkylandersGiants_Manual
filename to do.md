## Priorities (in order):
* ~~verify that all locations are correct and accessible~~
* ~~add remaining winged sapphires~~--------------~~
* ~~remove luck-o-tron wheel locations and add luck-o-tron slots as items~~
* ~~add option to make chapters individual items (non-linear mode) and require "Kaos Shards" to beat the goal~~
    * ~~for these two, specify that an existing save is required~~
    * ~~maybe make them two options; "the only reason it took as long as i did to beat the randomizer is because the game is long" - Emmet~~
    * ~~specifically, need to tweak region requirements to use the individual levels and programmatically change region connections based~~\
        ~~on the yaml option~~
    * ~~need a way to require the exact amount of map fragments that the player set (requirements function isn't working and thinks the items aren't there)~~
