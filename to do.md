## Priorities (in order):
* ~~verify that all locations are correct and accessible~~
* ~~add remaining winged sapphires~~--------------~~
* ~~remove luck-o-tron wheel locations and add luck-o-tron slots as items~~
* ~~add option to make chapters individual items (non-linear mode) and require "Kaos Shards" to beat the goal~~
    * ~~for these two, specify that an existing save is required~~
    * ~~maybe make them two options; "the only reason it took as long as i did to beat the randomizer is because the game is long" - Emmet~~
    * ~~specifically, need to tweak region requirements to use the individual levels and programmatically change region connections based~~\
        ~~on the yaml option~~
    * ~~need a way to require the exact amount of map fragments that the player set (requirements function isn't working and thinks the items aren't there)~~
* ~~bowler, balloon, and birthday hat need to be moved to the hub region~~
    * ~~bowler and balloon aren't even locations. sort that out~~
* ~~old gen skylanders don't have heroic challenges, so make sure there aren't errors when excluding those skylanders~~
    * ~~skylander removal isn't working in the first place~~
* ~~some skystones challenges are really hard~~
    * ~~Autogyro Adventure has 4 elemental squares~~
    * ~~Rumbletown is all Axecutioners~~
* ~~Chest - The Evershifting Hall #2 should be Chest - Magician's Lighthouse~~
* ~~in non-linear mode, make soul abilities per skylander~~
* ~~chest - cheese cavern should be Chest - Failing Fields~~
* ~~chest - secret cave should be Chest - Frightful Filtration Pools~~
* ~~remove Bringing Order to Kaos! Speedrun~~
* ~~add items for the ship vault (Open Ship Vault 11? infinite?)~~
* when the next manual stable releases, change All Levels Perfected to X Levels Perfected, where X is the number of chapters specified in NumChaptersToBeat




* categorize active items based on series?
* ~~add heavy hitter trap - forces player into hard difficulty until they beat a level (if already on hard or nightmare, pat self on back)~~
