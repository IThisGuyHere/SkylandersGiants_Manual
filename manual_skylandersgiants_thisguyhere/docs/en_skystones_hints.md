# Skystones Guide
The purpose of this guide is to provide non-linear players with hints on how to beat some of the tougher skystones matches (especially their feasibility with the debug deck). It does not include complete guides, but offers a starting point. 

## Chapter 3
The game doesn't let you do either battle here until you have the starter deck, so visit Dreadbeard in the hub first. The battle in the undead area is pretty easy.
### Quigley
Leave this little #### to burn in hell. His ENTIRE deck is Axecutioners, which have three attack on every side. The best way to beat him is to use a 4-attack stone to take one of his Axecutioners, and ensure that any skystones he takes from you can be taken back. If you don't want to deal with him, just use a cheat. He gives a really good stone.

## Chapter 8
### Gurglefin
Gurglefin will always start with one of two stones: a Mace Major in the top right, or a Drow Lancemaster 3 in the bottom right. Reset until he plays the lancemaster, then play one of yours to the left of it. The D Riveter is your biggest threat, so make sure he doesn't play it against the right wall.
### Fangs
This one is pretty much impossible to beat with the debug deck since you have no way to counter the water tile. Come back after you have gotten at least one decent stone (Gurglefin has one, and there is another in this level's shop).

## Chapter 9
Only one of the battles here is possible with the debug deck, and one is required to compelte the level. Either buy a cheat, buy the shadow duke from the shop, or get some stones from the hub first.
### Kensington
Impossible with the debug deck. He uses all frigid chompies, which have no exposed sides that a drow lancemaster can take. Avoid until you have better stones (like Conlan's or the ones in the hub).
### Butterworth
Impossible due to the trog wanderers and undead space. Avoid until you have better stones.
### Conlan
Possible but incredibly difficult with the debug deck because it requires incredible rng. There's a life tile, which he often protects the bottom of for his goliath drow. Avoid until you have better stones. 
If you do want to try the debug deck, reset until he plays top right, then play top left. If he plays a drow lancemaster in top mid, put one on middle left. You need him to put the drow archer in bottom left. If he places an inhuman shield in mid, you lose. The inhuman shields are impossible to take sice you can't attack below.

## Chapter 10
Only one battle here, but it can be difficult even with the starter deck.
### Criggler
Impossible with the debug deck, and difficult with the starter deck. He has two inhuman shields and two d-riveters, plus an earth tile in the center. The Chompy bot 9000 stone from the shop won't help much, either. Avoid until you have better stones.

## Chapter 14
Only one battle here, but it is almost as bad as Quigley's. I recommend coming back later.
### Arkeyan Weaponmaster
AVOID unless you have stones that can be played on at least two of the four elemental tiles. The tiles are for water, earth, fire, and air. Chompy 3 is earth, but it's weak. Arkeyan bomber is air and fits nicely on that tile, but the weaponmaster can take it easily.
