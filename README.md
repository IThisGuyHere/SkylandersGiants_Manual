# SkylandersSpyrosAdventure_Manual
Manual Archipelago world for Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure

This manual requires a new save and at least one Skylander of each element. Any Skylanders you do not own or do not want to use should be included in the characters_to_exclude yaml option. Currently, you start with one random Skylander and the first chapter unlocked. Depending on the chosen goal, you either need to defeat Kaos in Chapter 22 or get 3 stars on every level (essentially, complete everything). 



## Required Hardware/Software

- Dolphin or another emulator that supports the Portal of Power, or a playable PC/console copy of the game. If using a physical Portal, at least one Skylander from each element is manditory.

## Installation Procedures

- Set up like you would any other multiworld. Place the apworld in the custom_worlds folder of the Archipelago client with all other multiworlds, place this and all other yamls in the players folder, open the Archipelago client and click Generate. A complete guide can be found in the manual Discord server <a href=https://discord.com/channels/1097532591650910289/1163846227570462820/1163846227570462820>here</a>.
